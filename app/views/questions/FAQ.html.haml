  %h2 Frequently Asked Questions
%h3 Is my juvenile record a criminal conviction?
%p
  No, a juvenile record is not a criminal conviction, even if you were "found guilty" in juvenile court. In Illinois, you cannot be convicted of a crime in juvenile court, because juvenile court is separate from (adult) criminal court. If a job application asks you about criminal convictions, you should not reveal your juvenile record. If you think a job has seen your juvenile record, contact the Juvenile Expungement Help Desk at 312-229-6359.

%h3 How much does juvenile expungement cost?
%p
  It costs $124 to expunge a single arrest, plus an extra $64 for each additional arrest - this includes filing fees (to the court) and the expungement fee (to the IL state police). However, many people qualify for a fee waiver that makes expungement free.
%h3 How long does the process take?
%p Usually, a court date is scheduled about 1.5 months from the petition date. After a judge approves the petition on the court date, it takes about 2 months for the police to erase records. So, 3.5 months total. If necessary, expungement can be expedited to about 2.5 months total.
