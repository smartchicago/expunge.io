%h2 About
%p This is a resource for people with juvenile records in Illinois.
%p A juvenile record can be a barrier to employment, education, and housing. Luckily, juvenile records can be erased through the expungement process. However, while the majority of juvenile records can be erased, few people know about or take advantage of the opportunity. Expunge.io seeks to clarify juvenile expungement, with the hope of more people getting their records erased!
